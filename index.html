  <h2>Manual Installation Instructions</h2>
  <p>To install this Progressive Web App (PWA) manually, follow the steps below depending on your device and browser:
  </p>

  <h3>On Desktop:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> Visit the website and click the "Add to Home Screen" prompt that appears in the
      address bar. Alternatively, click the three dots (menu) in the top-right corner and select <strong>"Install [App
        Name]"</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> If you are using Edge, you should see an "Install" prompt in the address bar.
      Alternatively, click the three dots (menu) in the top-right corner and select <strong>"Apps" â†’ "Install this site
        as an app"</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> Currently, Firefox does not support PWA installation prompts, but you can
      manually create a shortcut to the app by saving the webpage to your desktop. It will not be installed as a full
      PWA with offline support, though.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>On Mobile:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Chrome on Android:</strong> Open the website and you should see the "Add to Home Screen" prompt.
      Tap it to add the app to your home screen. If the prompt doesn't appear, tap the three dots (menu) and select
      <strong>"Add to Home Screen"</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Safari on iOS:</strong> Open the website and tap the "Share" button (the square with an arrow). Scroll
      down and tap <strong>"Add to Home Screen"</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Edge on Android:</strong> Similar to Chrome, tap the three dots (menu) and select <strong>"Add
        to Home Screen"</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
  <p>The service worker is optional. While it enables offline functionality and caching for faster loading, the key
    feature that allows the app to be installed is the <strong>manifest.json</strong> file, which should be placed in
    the <strong>public</strong> folder. You can still install and use the app even if the service worker is not present.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, the <strong>manifest.json</strong> file must be linked in the <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> section
    of your HTML file using the <code>&lt;link rel="manifest" href="public/manifest.json"&gt;</code> tag. This is
    essential for the app to be recognized as a Progressive Web App and for the installation prompt to appear.</p>
